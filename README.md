# Inverter Design and Analysis using Cadence Virtuoso
1. INVERTER Characteristics:
1.1 Creating the Schematic
1.2 Creating the Symbol of Inverter
1.3 Creating the symbolâ€™s testbench
1.4 Analysis of Inverter (Transient, DC analysis)

2. Switching Threshold of Inverter (for same mid voltage for Vin=Vout=(Vdd/2))
3. Inverter same rise time and fall time (wpn for same rise time and fall time)
4. Noise Margin of Inverter

   1.1 Creating the Schematic**
   Add instances like NMOS, PMOS, Vdc and ground joining then to form an inverter circuit.
